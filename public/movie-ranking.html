<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hidalgo</h3>

<p>For me, this is an excellent adventure movie that highlights the bond between a man and his horse, 
   as they overcome challenges and surpass everyone's expectations together.</p>

<h3>Jurrasic park</h3>
<p>This is a movie that lives in my childhood memories and showcases every kid's dream, 
   while also telling an interesting story and making you think about the consequences of using science without considering the risks.</p>

<h3>Indiana Jones and the raiders of the lost ark</h3>
<p>This is my favorite action hero and the best movieâ€”full of action and suspense! 
   It's the one I loved from my childhood, and I just can't stop watching it!</p>
